Your mother would cook food in an iron pot       hung over the fire on an iron pothook. Your father would fell trees with       an iron axe, cut boards with an iron saw, and hammer iron nails with an       iron hammer. Even your teacher would use iron, ringing an iron bell to call       you and other pupils to school.<br>      <br>      <font color="#FFFFFF">___</font>During the first years of America's settlement,       all iron was imported from England. Some colonists attempted to make iron,       but without success. In 1643 skilled ironworkers were brought from England       to Massachusetts to build and operate an iron-producing plant. By 1650 the       Saugus Iron Works was manufacturing iron as fine as any made in England.<br>      <br>      <font color="#FFFFFF">___</font>As you look through this book, try to imagine       that you are taking a giant step backward in time to the year 1650. Then,       more than 300 years ago, boys and girls like you worked and played at Hammersmith,       the ironworks village named for the ironworkers' former home in England.       Everyone had to work hard to obtain food, shelter, and clothing, because       there were no labor-saving appliances.<br>      <br>      <font color="#FFFFFF">___</font>Boys and girls helped to grow vegetables       and fruits, pick wild berries, and catch fish. They did many chores around       their homes, such as fetching firewood and drawing water from a well. They       tended sheep, carded wool, spun yarn, and wove cloth for dresses and suits.       </font></td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td width="376" valign="top" bordercolor="2" height="212">       <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>        <br>        <font color="#FFFFFF">___</font>To understand their situation, pretend         that you and your parents have left England, sailed for many weeks across         the stormy Atlantic Ocean, and are now settling into a new home in Hammersmith.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>        </font></p>      </td>    <td width="373" valign="top" bordercolor="2" height="212">       <div align="right"><img src="../images/backintime_childrenrunning.GIF" width="370" height="204" alt="colonial children running"></div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td valign="top" bordercolor="2" colspan="2">       <div align="center">         <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="4"><b>1.</b>           Who used iron in colonial days? <br>          <br>          <b>2.</b> Name some iron objects used then. <br>          <br>          <b>3.</b> How did living conditions differ from those of today? <br>          <br>          <b>4.</b> Where was iron first successfully manufactured in North America?</font></font></p>        <div align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="4"></font></font></div>        <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="4"><a href="task_briefsummary.htm"><img src="../navimages/upleftarrow.gif" width="40" height="40" alt="back" border="0"></a></font></font></div>    </td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td bordercolor="2" colspan="2"></td>  </tr></table></body></html>
