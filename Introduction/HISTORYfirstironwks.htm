By 1643 there were more than twenty towns and over 15,000 people in       the colony. The settlers brought iron goods and tools with them, such as       axes, nails, saws, kettles, and pots. If they needed new items they had       to be ordered from England at high cost. One of the settlers' greatest needs       was for iron. The colony needed a place to manufacture its own iron. Eastern       Massachusetts had all of the materials needed for iron making -- water for       transportation and power, wood for charcoal, iron ore and a flux.<br>      <br>      <font color="#FFFFFF">___</font>In 1646 at Saugus, Massachusetts, an iron       works was built to meet the demands for iron. The iron works mainly produced       wrought iron bars - merchant bars, flats, and nail rod - which were used       in making tools and as building materials. Some cast iron products such       as pots, firebacks, skillets and kettles were also made. The settlement       where the ironworkers lived was called Hammersmith. At Hammersmith, there       were houses for the ironworkers, a farm, and other buildings.<br>      </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>      <font color="#FFFFFF">___</font>Although the iron works produced good iron,       the iron works was out of business by 1670. There were many reasons why       it failed, such as management problems. The iron works was very expensive       to run, they had to go farther away to get natural resources, and there       was competition. Gradually, the iron works fell into ruin where it was covered       by layers of earth and leaves. The only reminders of the iron works were       the slag pile and the Iron Works House, which may have been the home of       the agent of the iron works. So how is it that today we know much about       the iron works and can visit the site and see the reconstructed buildings?<br>      <br>      <font color="#FFFFFF">___</font>Court records and the writings of people       have been studied. However, much of the iron works history was not written       down. Many of the ironworkers and their families could not read or write       and there were no sketches, drawings, or detailed descriptions of the iron       works. Think about what was left behind and laid buried for over three hundred       years. The history of Saugus Iron Works can be told through its artifacts;       objects that are made or used by humans. Archaeology is the study of people       and past cultures through the artifacts they leave behind. Archaeology helped       us to learn information about the iron works and the people of Hammersmith       that never would have been found in written records.<br>      <br>      <font color="#FFFFFF">___</font>Starting in 1948, the iron works was excavated       by archaeologist, Roland Wells Robbins, and a team of workers. A historian       was hired to find and study any written documents about the iron works.       Using the archaeological evidence and the historical documents a reconstruction       was built. We now know more about the beginnings of life, work, and industry       in America.<br>      The Saugus Iron Works National Historic Site is important because it celebrates       America's first successful iron works which helped the settlers to live       in the New World. More importantly, the iron works helped to build an American       iron and steel industry.</font></td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td height="75" colspan="2" valign="top">       <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>        <a href="task_briefsummary.htm" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('Backintime2','','../navimages/downleftarrow.gif',1)"><img name="Backintime2" border="0" src="../navimages/upleftarrow.gif" width="40" height="40"></a>         </font> </p>    </td>  </tr></table></body></html>
